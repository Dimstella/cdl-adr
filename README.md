# Causal Deep Learning for the detection of Adverse Drug Reactions

Causal Deep/Machine Learning (CDL/CML) is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) paradigm gaining attention, including precision medicine applications. The combination of causal inference (CI) and AI could mine explainable causal relationships between data features, providing useful insights for various applications, e.g. pharmacovigilance (PV) signal detection upon Real-World Data (RWD). The objective of this study is to demonstrate the use of CDL for potential PV signal validation using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as input data sources.
